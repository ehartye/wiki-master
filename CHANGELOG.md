# Changelog

## 0.5.1 — 2026-07-21

### Re-clip identity is content, not location

A clipper's duplicate check matched on the **binary's path**. Move the binaries — as the
0.5.0 vault rule requires — and every lookup misses, so a re-clip pass writes a second
copy of content the vault already holds, beside the original as `<slug>-<hash7>.md`.
Slug disambiguation was working correctly; it was being asked the wrong question.

`clip-pdf`, `clip-docx` and `clip-xlsx` now check the extracted body's **content hash**
before writing and report `exists (same content): <path>` instead of creating a second
file; `clip-and-repoint` reads that as a reuse, not a failure. Disambiguation is
unchanged, so a genuinely different document sharing a title still gets its own file.

### Vault repair: `dedupe-clippings`

`node scripts/dedupe-clippings.mjs` (dry-run; `--apply` to delete) removes clippings that
duplicate another's content-hash, keeping the copy the vault cites. It **refuses** any
group where every copy is cited or none is — the first case is a deliberate duplicate
(one paper bookmarked twice, documented in the summary's dedup note), the second has no
keeper it can prove correct. Idempotent and convergent.

Vaults synced from another machine should run it once and commit. A vault that ran the
0.5.0 clip-and-repoint pass will also have duplicate `wiki/sources/` pages recording the
same `source-hashes`; those need a judgment call and are reported by `/wiki-lint`, not
auto-merged — the newer page can hold specifics the older one lacks.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07-21

### The vault holds only `.md` and the images those `.md` files reference

Binaries (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.zip`) are **never** in the vault, and the tooling
**never moves them**. They stay wherever you keep them. `clip-pdf` / `clip-docx` read a
binary **in place** and write only the resulting `.md` into `raw/clippings/`, recording the
binary's own path in the clipping's `source:`. Download a PDF → "clip that" → the PDF does
not move; a `.md` appears in the vault.

### OCR escalation now triggers on quality, not just quantity

`clip-pdf` previously escalated to OCR only when the text layer was *thin*
(`wordCount < 100`). A broken or symbol-font PDF yields **plenty** of words — just corrupted
ones — so those were never escalated and landed as `fidelity: degraded` with OCR untried.
Escalation now also fires when the extraction assesses as degraded, and keeps whichever pass
reads measurably better (`shouldTryOcr` / `preferBetterExtraction`), so OCR can never make a
clipping worse.

### Triage dispositions now do the work they name

A `reclip` disposition used to close the issue without performing the re-clip, so
requests piled up unnoticed (30 sources on the reference vault, one dispositioned
three times because it kept resurfacing). `apply-reclips.mjs` closes the loop:

```
node scripts/apply-reclips.mjs            # dry run
node scripts/apply-reclips.mjs --apply
```

It folds the log for what was asked (latest disposition wins, so changing your mind
is honoured), **derives** from the vault what is still needed — a source whose
clipping now reads clean needs nothing — re-extracts through the right clipper with
OCR escalation, and carries the content hash forward to every citing summary so the
re-clipped source is not orphaned. A re-extraction that is still degraded is
reported and discarded rather than swapped in.

Related: triage no longer *logs* fidelity issues. A degraded clipping leaves its own
artifact (`fidelity:` frontmatter), so it is derived and self-corrects; only problems
that leave no trace (a 403, a blocked domain) belong in the append-only log.
Dispositions now suppress derived flags too — previously "acceptable" never stuck.

### Repairing a vault that has binaries in it

An older vault may contain binaries that summaries cite directly (`sources: ["[[X.pdf]]"]`).
Those citations have no readable provenance and no `source-hash` to join on. To repair:

1. **Move the binaries out of the vault** to any location you choose (this is a one-time
   cleanup — the tooling neither knows nor manages that location).
2. **Clip and repoint**, pointing the pass at wherever you put them:

   ```
   node scripts/clip-and-repoint.mjs --from=<dir>            # dry run
   node scripts/clip-and-repoint.mjs --from=<dir> --apply
   ```

   For each dangling citation it clips the binary in place, writes the `.md` to
   `raw/clippings/`, repoints every citing summary, and stamps `source-hashes`. Re-running is
   safe: a binary already clipped is reused, not re-clipped. Degraded extractions are still
   repointed (their `fidelity:` records the caveat) and filed to `/wiki-triage`.
3. **Stamp any hash-less clippings.** Clippings written before `source-hash` existed
   carry none, so they can never be hash-joined and their summaries stay stuck at
   `backfillPending`:

   ```
   node scripts/repair-missing-hash.mjs --apply
   node scripts/backfill-source-hashes.mjs --apply   # record the new hashes on the summaries
   ```

4. **Verify** with a health run. `provenanceGaps`, `backlog`, `missingHash`, and
   `backfillPending` should all reach 0; any remainder is a source with no text
   extractor (e.g. a spreadsheet), which is reference data rather than a prose source.

### Extraction prerequisites — and a Windows gotcha that will bite you

- **poppler** (`pdftotext`, `pdftoppm`) — PDF text + rasterizing. Required.
- **tesseract** — OCR fallback for scanned/degraded PDFs. Optional but strongly recommended.
- **pandoc** — `.docx` extraction. Required only for Word sources.

**On Windows, run extraction from PowerShell, not Git Bash.** Invoked from Git Bash,
`pdftotext` can emit Latin-1 bytes that Node then decodes as UTF-8, turning every non-ASCII
glyph into `U+FFFD`. The symptom is deceptive: ASCII prose extracts perfectly while every
equation, accent, and symbol becomes `░░░░`, so the clipping looks like a font/OCR problem when
it is purely an encoding artifact of the shell. The same PDF extracts cleanly under PowerShell.
If a clipping shows a high replacement-character count, re-extract from PowerShell before
concluding the source is bad. (See also `CLAUDE.md` §6.)

Also note a freshly-installed tool may be registered on the user PATH but absent from an
already-running shell's environment — verify with `Get-Command <tool>` from a new shell rather
than assuming it is missing.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-21

### Ingest-state tracking moves to a content-hash join

The ingest backlog is now computed by matching each clipping's `source-hash`
against the `source-hashes` recorded on `wiki/sources/` pages, instead of testing
whether a `[[wikilink]]` resolves. This fixes two false-positives that inflated the
backlog (172 phantom items on the reference vault, ~0 real):

- **Hash-suffix mismatch** — a summary citing `[[Title]]` never resolved to the
  clipping file `Title-<hash7>.md`. Hash equality is immune to the suffix.
- **Binaries counted as sources** — `.pdf/.xlsx/.zip` originals can never be a
  summary target; only `.md` clippings are now in the backlog universe.

It also delivers **re-ingest-on-change** for free (a re-clipped source gets a new
hash and reappears in the backlog) and adds two health metrics: `missingHash`
(clippings lacking a `source-hash`) and `backfillPending` (migration progress).

New frontmatter: `wiki/sources/` pages carry `source-hashes: [<sha256>, …]`. The
`sources: [[…]]` wikilink is retained for navigation. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-21-hash-ingest-state-design.md`.

### Migrating existing vaults — run once per vault

A vault written before this release has source pages without `source-hashes`. A
transitional fallback keeps them credited (nothing regresses), but the backlog will
show phantom items again until the vault is migrated. **Agents: repair the vault by
running the one-time backfill.** From the plugin root:

```
node scripts/backfill-source-hashes.mjs            # dry-run: prints the plan + review queue
node scripts/backfill-source-hashes.mjs --apply    # writes source-hashes into wiki/sources/*.md
```

(The script resolves the vault via `WIKI_MASTER_VAULT`, default `~/.wiki-master-vault`.)

It is **idempotent** (only fills pages still missing the key) and **guesses
nothing**: ambiguous or unresolved citations are reported for human review, never
written. Expected benign residual — citations to binary originals (`unresolved`) and
clippings with no `source-hash` (`nohash`).

- **If your vault is git-synced across machines:** run the backfill on one machine
  and commit the vault. Every other machine is then already repaired — the
  `source-hashes` live in the vault's markdown, not in the plugin — so no per-machine
  action is needed beyond pulling the vault.
- **If machines hold independent (unsynced) vaults:** run it once on each machine.
- **Verify:** a health run should show `backfillPending` approaching 0 and the ingest
  backlog dropping to its true residual.

A follow-up release will remove the transitional link-resolution fallback once
vaults are expected to be migrated (track readiness via `backfillPending`).
